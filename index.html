                <h3>Beef</h3>

                <p>
                    This beautiful cut of USDA Choice beef makes for an excellent, flavorful main course. A good boneless beef ribeye steak like this one only needs minor preparation; brush both sides with a little bit of oil, sear it quickly on a strong heat and then bring its rich flavor to life with some garlic and thyme. USDA Choice is the second highest-grade beef that we offer, with a little less fat marbling than Prime.
